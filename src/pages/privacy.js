        This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected,
        used and disclosed by Meal Prep Planner and Diary (“MealPrep”) when you
        use the mobile application (the “App”).
      </p>
      <p>
        By accepting our Privacy Policy, you agree to let MealPrep collect, use
        and disclose information about you in accordance with the purposes
        listed below. The App is not intended for use by children under 13 and
        we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
        We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes,
        we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and,
        depending on the specific changes, we may provide you with additional
        notice or require a renewed consent (e.g., by adding a statement to our
        website’s homepage or in the App). We encourage you to review the
        Privacy Policy whenever you access the App to stay informed about our
        information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
      </p>
      <h3>Collection of Information</h3>
      <h4>Information You Provide to Us</h4>
      <p>

        information about how we collect, use and disclose such information.
      </p>

        The App may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools

        take in the App with other media, and vice versa. You must be at least
        13 years of age to use any social sharing features integrated in the
        App. The use of such features enables the sharing of information with
        your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with
        the entity that provides the social sharing feature. For more
        information about the purpose and scope of data collection and
        processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the
        privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.

      <p>
        We may allow third parties to serve contextual advertisements and
        provide analytics services in connection with the App. These entities
        may use various identifiers to collect information about your use of the
        App, including your IP address, MAC address, device identifiers,
        software and hardware information, time zone and usage information. This
        information may be used by MealPrep and others to, among other things,
        determine the popularity of certain content, deliver contextual
        advertising and content and better understand your activity on the App.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third-party ad serving and analytics technologies are integrated into
        the App, so if you do not want to be subject to these technologies, do
        not use or access the App.
